def os_keyring():

    """
    Returns an instance of the appropriate keyring backend based on the current operating system.

    This function uses the `platform.system()` function to determine the current operating system and then imports the appropriate keyring backend module. The following keyring backends are supported:
    - Windows: `keyring.backends.Windows.WinVaultKeyring`
    - macOS: `keyring.backends.macOS.Keyring`
    - Linux: `keyring.backends.SecretService.Keyring`

    The function is decorated with `@cache`, which means that the result of the first call to `os_keyring()` is cached and subsequent calls will return the cached result.

    Returns:
        An instance of the appropriate keyring backend.
